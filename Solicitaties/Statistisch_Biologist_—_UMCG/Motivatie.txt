Biosketch - Tom de Groot

BSc in Chemistry with Chemistry of Life track. Bachelor thesis on graph neural networks for NMR prediction in Python.

Versatile with biology specific programs like SnapGene, PyMol and BLAST. Additionally, worked and trained on Graph/relational-based data.

Coding: Python; RDKit, TenserFlow/PyTorch, Scikit, and common libraries. Comfortable in big dataformats such as JSON, CSV, SQL/SQLite, XML. Large database handling and data analysis/statistics. Multiple small and large scale personal and work projects implementing these. (e.g. modelling vaccination risk, immigration data, automated speech to script tooling).

Biostatistics: exposure to multi omics integration, ANOVA/MANOVA analysis, regression models, XGBoost, MLPs and other related Neural Network solutions.

Biochemistry and lab: BSL 2 practice, worked on PCR, DNA and RNA isolation, solid understanding of protein and nucleic acid chemistry from the Chemistry of Life track, focussed on DNA and protein editing.

Collaboration and communication: fully fluent Dutch and English, concise reporting for clinical and technical stakeholders, experience in Agile teams. Multiple years of work experience in project management and support roles, alongside freelance coding.

Fit for the role: ready to analyze and integrate large omics datasets in heart failure, support clinicians, and develop validated tools and publishable results. Excited to travel to learn and collaborate.

In short; recently graduated biochemist with a specialisation in coding and data sciences, excited for this opportunity.
