About the role
We are looking for an AI Engineer to help shape the future of certification services. This is more than building AI systems, it’s about redefining how we work and deliver value in Business Assurance.

- Generative AI Development: Design, deploy and update production-grade AI systems using LLMs and multimodal models. Fine-tune models, optimize prompts, and integrate RAG for context-aware responses.
- AI DevOps & MLOps: Set up CI/CD pipelines, manage containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and automate retraining using MLflow and cloud-native tools.
- Communication & Impact: Deliver demos (Streamlit), prototypes, and reports that make AI systems tangible for stakeholders.
- Continuous Innovation: Stay ahead of trends, experiment with frameworks like LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and others.
